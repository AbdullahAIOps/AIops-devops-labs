# Container Management Challenges Report

## 1. Port Conflicts
- **Issue**: Multiple containers cannot bind to the same port
- **Manual Solution**: Track and assign unique ports for each container
- **Complexity**: Increases with number of applications and instances

## 2. Resource Management
- **Issue**: No automatic resource allocation or limits
- **Manual Solution**: Manually set memory and CPU limits for each container
- **Risk**: Resource contention and system instability

## 3. Scaling Challenges
- **Issue**: Manual deployment of multiple instances
- **Time Consuming**: Each instance requires individual commands
- **Error Prone**: High chance of configuration mistakes

## 4. Failure Recovery
- **Issue**: No automatic restart of failed containers
- **Manual Process**: Constant monitoring and manual intervention required
- **Downtime**: Extended service interruption during manual recovery

## 5. Load Balancing
- **Issue**: No built-in load distribution
- **Manual Setup**: Requires separate load balancer configuration
- **Maintenance**: Manual updates when instances change

## 6. Service Discovery
- **Issue**: Hard-coded IP addresses and ports
- **Brittle**: Configuration breaks when containers restart with new IPs
- **Scalability**: Difficult to manage as system grows

## 7. Configuration Management
- **Issue**: No centralized configuration management
- **Inconsistency**: Different configurations across instances
- **Updates**: Manual updates to each container individually
