# Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm Comparison

## Architecture
**Kubernetes:**
- Master-worker architecture with multiple components
- etcd for distributed storage
- Complex but highly scalable

**Docker Swarm:**
- Simpler architecture integrated with Docker Engine
- Built-in distributed storage
- Easier to set up but less feature-rich

## Learning Curve
**Kubernetes:**
- Steeper learning curve
- More concepts to understand (pods, deployments, services, etc.)
- Extensive documentation and community support

**Docker Swarm:**
- Gentler learning curve
- Familiar Docker commands
- Limited advanced features

## Scaling Capabilities
**Kubernetes:**
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
- Custom metrics scaling
- Advanced scheduling

**Docker Swarm:**
- Basic service scaling
- Simple replica management
- Limited autoscaling options

## Service Discovery
**Kubernetes:**
- DNS-based service discovery
- Service mesh integration
- Advanced networking policies

**Docker Swarm:**
- Built-in service discovery
- Overlay networks
- Basic load balancing

## Ecosystem
**Kubernetes:**
- Vast ecosystem (Helm, Istio, Prometheus)
- Cloud provider integrations
- CNCF graduated project

**Docker Swarm:**
- Limited third-party integrations
- Docker-centric ecosystem
- Simpler toolchain
