# Kubernetes Storage Best Practices

## 1. Storage Class Selection
- Use appropriate storage classes for different workloads
- Consider performance requirements (SSD vs HDD)
- Plan for backup and disaster recovery

## 2. Resource Management
- Set appropriate storage requests and limits
- Monitor storage usage regularly
- Implement storage quotas in namespaces

## 3. Data Persistence Strategy
- Use StatefulSets for stateful applications
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Consider data replication for critical applications

## 4. Security Considerations
- Use proper RBAC for storage resources
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement network policies for storage access

## 5. Monitoring and Alerting
- Monitor PV/PVC status regularly
- Set up alerts for storage capacity
- Track storage performance metrics

## 6. Cleanup and Maintenance
- Regularly clean up unused PVCs
- Monitor orphaned PVs
- Implement retention policies
