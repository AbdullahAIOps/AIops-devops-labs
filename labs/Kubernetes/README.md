# Kubernetes Labs Index

This repository contains my hands-on Kubernetes labs organized by certification track.  
Each entry lists the lab markdown files I created while working through the curriculum. I keep lab notes, command examples, and troubleshooting steps inside each lab file.

## Notes & usage

- Lab files follow this naming pattern: `Lab <n>_ <Title>_lab.md`.  
- Each lab file contains step-by-step commands, YAML examples, troubleshooting notes, and results from my hands-on runs.  
- How to use this repo:
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Open the lab folder you want to follow.
  3. Run commands in a suitable lab environment (Minikube, kubeadm, or the provided cloud VM) and follow the notes inside each file.
- Want an index or link updates? I can convert this index into a linked table or auto-generate it from the folder structure on request.
